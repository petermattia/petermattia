Glimpse's first publication is out! You can read more about it on Glimpse's blog [here](https://glimp.se/blog/demo-dataset-publication). 
You can find the paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2024.110614) and the dataset [here](https://doi.org/10.25452/figshare.plus.25330501).
You can also interactively explore the data on the [Glimpse Portal](https://app.glimp.se).

Five years after our [*Nature Energy*](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-019-0356-8) paper and its corresponding dataset was published,
I'm excited to release this unique battery testing dataset. The great thing about CT is that it takes minutes, not months, per test!
I hope this dataset helps others begin to appreciate the power of high-throughput CT for evaluating batteries.
