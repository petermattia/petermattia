Copying from the Glimpse [blog post](https://glimp.se/blog/aged-prismatic-cell-publication):

The main goal of this paper was to evaluate how external pressure impacts the aging behavior of commercial prismatic cells. The results are clear: While cells cycled with mechanical constraints exhibit minimal capacity loss, these same cells cycled without any mechanical constraint exhibit catastrophic capacity loss. The unconstrained cells also have obvious bulging, implying significant gas generation. However, the location of the gas was ambiguous: did the gassing affect the jellyroll’s structural integrity, or did the jellyroll stay intact?

CT scanning the cells periodically over life (see below) quickly revealed the answer: The jellyroll of the unconstrained cell began exhibiting mechanical deformation as early as 200 cycles and then deformed massively (delamination, visible gas pockets, etc.) upon subsequent cycling. The “knee” in the capacity-cycle number from 300 to 500 cycles tracks with when major cell deformation occurs as visualized via CT.
