In 2022, I worked with a broad consortium of contributors with affiliations in five countries
and seven US states across academia, national labs, and industry to publish
["'Knees' in lithium-ion battery aging trajectories"](https://doi.org/10.1149/1945-7111/ac6d13).
You can find a summary [here](https://petermattia.com/articles/2022/07/10/knees.html).
I really enjoyed diving into this difficult problem with this diverse team.
Since then, this work has been highlighted in two interesting venues.

The first is the [*Wall Street Journal*](https://www.wsj.com/tech/you-dont-need-a-new-iphone-you-just-need-a-new-battery-dc4caaaa?st=6wwgtlxt39bujnx&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink).
I chatted with [Joanna Stern](https://www.wsj.com/news/author/joanna-stern)
about why her iPhone battery was degrading faster than expected.
Turns out her iPhone had 494 cycles after just 1 year, which I suppose is on brand for a personal tech columnist.
I enjoyed our brief conversation, and I think the article did a great job explaining battery degradation to
a general audience.

The second is the [EU Batteries Regulation report](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3fcf6f9d-c95b-11ee-95d9-01aa75ed71a1/language-en).
This report is a review of battery performance and durability for the EU's [upcoming minimum battery durability regulations](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0798#:~:text=Article%2010%2C%20together%20with%20Annex,vehicle%20batteries%20with%20internal%20storage.).
Our work is cited nine times in this report.

Overall, I'm pleased that this work has impact beyond battery nerds and can help folks
ranging from policymakers and tech columnists.
