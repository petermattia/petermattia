[Glimpse](https://glimp.se)'s mission is to enable battery quality at scale.
We recently wrote a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01065) discussing this problem at length.
Over the course of this work, we identified a number of open questions that I think would be very interesting for academic research.
I think many of these problems are both highly impactful yet deeply fundamentally interesting.
Here are ten that I think are particularly interesting, complete with emojis:

1. 📋 What are all possible battery defects that can cause functional failure or safety events? Which of these absolutely cannot be present in products?

2. 📊 How can we set anode-cathode overhang specs as a function of cell design and use case?

3. 🟠 🕳️ Under what circumstances should we be concerned about metallic contaminants, separator pinholes, and similar?

4. ↪️ 🍽️ When do buckled and/or high-curvature electrode stacks lead to lithium plating?

5. 🖐🏼 How does poor cell-level conformance impact pack reliability?

6. 🚗 What pack designs maximize pack-level reliability?

7. 🔋📦👝 What cell designs (chemistry, form factor) maximize cell-level reliability?

8. ⚖️ How can we quantify the tradeoffs between energy and quality?

9. ⏳ Can we design accelerated tests and/or prediction models for hard-to-predict functional failures and safety events?

10. 🔬 What is the minimum set of characterization techniques needed for comprehensive battery lifetime evaluation? (Multimodal foundation models?)
