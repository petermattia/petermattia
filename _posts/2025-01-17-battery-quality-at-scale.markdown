Our open-access perspective paper on the challenges of scaling battery manufacturing was just published in [*Nature Communications*](https://rdcu.be/d6FFQ)!
In this paper, we discuss why battery quality is important, why it's hard to achieve in battery manufacturing, and how advanced inspection --- specifically CT --- can help.

I started working on this paper shortly after starting Glimpse in early 2023.
Two years later, I have to admit the final result already feels slightly dated (specifically, the highly optimistic introductory paragraph).
In the past two years, Western battery manufacturing ambitions have faced some major setbacks, [headlined by Northvolt's bankruptcy](https://www.reuters.com/technology/northvolt-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy-us-2024-11-21/).
Now, everyone in the industry recognizes that battery manufacturing is hard.
Nevertheless, I hope this paper can help the community by highlighting the challenges of quality control in battery manufacturing and the role of advanced inspection in achieving it.
