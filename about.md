I am the cofounder and CTO of [Glimpse](https://glimp.se); our mission is to enable battery quality at scale.
We are realizing this mission by scaling [CT scanning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_computed_tomography)
to achieve the throughputs needed for GWh-scale battery production.
Previously, I worked for [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com) on the Cell Qualification team.
I hold a PhD in [Materials Science and Engineering](https://mse.stanford.edu)
from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu)
and a BChE in [chemical engineering](https://cbe.udel.edu)
from the [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu).
[My graduate research](/research) focused on making lithium-ion batteries last longer
and charge faster through combining fundamental understanding and data-driven methods.

My primary professional interest is **accelerating the pace of battery development & production**.
I aim to understand battery technology from length scales of
[nanometers](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b01515) to [centimeters](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-1994-5)
and [everywhere in between](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/1945-7111/ac6d13/meta).
I also enjoy working with manufacturing data, lab data, and field data
to forecast battery lifetime and prevent battery failures.
While my background is in the physical sciences,
I've developed skills in software engineering, data analysis,
and computer vision to efficiently make sense of data from disparate sources.

Some personal tidbits about me can be found [here](/personal).

This is my personal website.

### Which Peter Attia are you?

Seeing how my website doesn't show up in the top results of a Google search for
"Peter Attia", the Peter Attias of this world are doing quite well! The good
news is I'm in good company; the bad news is it can be difficult to find me via
online (hence the "m" in [peter**m**attia.com](https://petermattia.com)).

In particular, one identically-named gentleman has a larger web presence than I.
I'm not [Peter Attia, M.D.](https://peterattiamd.com/about/),
although we both went to Stanford after studying engineering as an undergraduate.
I'm also not [this Peter Attia](https://twitter.com/peterattia),
who works on search engine optimization.
