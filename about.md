I'm currently working on a new venture.
I previously worked for [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com) as a battery data analyst.
I hold a PhD in [Materials Science and Engineering](https://mse.stanford.edu)
from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu)
and a BChE in [chemical engineering](https://cbe.udel.edu)
from the [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu).
[My graduate research](/research) focused on making lithium-ion batteries last longer
and charge faster through combining fundamental understanding and data-driven methods.

My primary professional interest is **accelerating the pace of battery development**.
As a battery data analyst, I work with manufacturing data, lab data, and field data
to forecast battery lifetime and prevent battery failures.
While my background is in the physical sciences,
I've developed skills in software engineering
and data analysis to efficiently make sense of data from disparate sources.

Some personal tidbits about me can be found [here](/personal).

This is my personal website.
The views expressed on this page are mine alone and not those of my employer.

### Which Peter Attia are you?

Seeing how my website doesn't show up in the top results of a Google search for
"Peter Attia", the Peter Attias of this world are doing quite well! The good
news is I'm in good company; the bad news is it can be difficult to find me via
online (hence the "m" in [peter**m**attia.com](https://petermattia.com)).

In particular, one identically-named gentleman has a larger web presence than I.
I'm not [Peter Attia, M.D.](https://peterattiamd.com/about/),
although we both went to Stanford after studying engineering as an undergraduate.
I'm also not [this Peter Attia](https://twitter.com/peterattia),
who works on search engine optimization.
