One of my life goals is to visit all 50 states.
International travel is one thing, but I've always wanted to better understand
this great big crazy country I call home.
I've had the advantage of growing up in Delaware to visit many Northeast states,
but I still have a ways to go!

I added this map as a way to track my progress. I'll add to it as I visit
more states. I only count a state if I've spent the night there.

Green means I've visited, blue means still on the list,
and red means I've lived there.

Current count: 34/50
