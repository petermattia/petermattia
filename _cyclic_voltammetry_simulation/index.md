title: "Cyclic voltammetry simulation tutorials"
description: Tutorials on cyclic voltammetry simulations
---

Last updated: May 10, 2018

These tutorials will explain the simulation that powers my simple
cyclic voltammetry apps.
I built these apps to better understand the fundamentals of
electrochemistry, and I hope they help you too!

I originally wrote this simulation in MATLAB and later ported it to JavaScript.
The JavaScript version lives [here](/cyclic_voltammetry_simulation/cvwebapp.html).
You can download the MATLAB version on the
[MATLAB File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/64011-cyclic-voltammetry-simulator)
and on [GitHub](https://github.com/petermattia/Cyclic-Voltammetry-Simulator).

My primary source for these simulations is [Bard and Faulkner, *Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications*, 2<sup>nd</sup> edition](https://www.amazon.com/Electrochemical-Methods-Fundamentals-Allen-Bard/dp/0471043729),
Appendix B.
I also validated my simulation with the
[Excel simulation](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00225/suppl_file/ed5b00225_si_001.xls) published [in this journal article](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00225).
You can also find an excellent (qualitative) cyclic voltammetry tutorial
[here](http://sop4cv.com/index.html).

Enjoy!
