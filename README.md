I'm currently the cofounder and CTO of [Glimpse](https://glimp.se). Previously, I worked for Tesla. Prior to Tesla, I was a graduate student in the [Chueh group](https://chuehlab.stanford.edu) in the Stanford Department of Materials Science and Engineering.

All code on GitHub is my own and not my employer's.
